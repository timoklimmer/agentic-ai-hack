    "# üìã Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `orchestration.ipynb` notebook implements a **sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system** for insurance claim processing using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** and **Azure AI Agent Service**. This notebook demonstrates advanced concurrent agent coordination to analyze insurance claims from multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",
    "- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: Agent orchestration framework\n",
    "- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Cloud-based agent hosting and management\n",
    "- **Concurrent Orchestration**: Parallel execution of multiple AI agents\n",
    "- **Azure Cosmos DB Integration**: Real-time data access through custom plugins\n",
    "- **Azure Identity**: Secure authentication for Azure services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Specializations\n",
    "The system creates three specialized AI agents that work concurrently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Claim Reviewer Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates claim documentation completeness\n",
    "   - Analyzes damage assessments and cost estimates\n",
    "   - Identifies inconsistencies or missing information\n",
    "   - Provides VALID/QUESTIONABLE/INVALID determinations\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for data retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Analyzer Agent**\n",
    "   - Detects fraud patterns and suspicious indicators\n",
    "   - Assesses claim authenticity and credibility\n",
    "   - Analyzes timing, amounts, and circumstances\n",
    "   - Provides LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk assessments\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for historical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìã Policy Checker Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates coverage against policy terms\n",
    "   - Interprets limits, deductibles, and exclusions\n",
    "   - Handles multiple policy types (Auto, Commercial, Motorcycle, etc.)\n",
    "   - Provides COVERED/NOT COVERED/PARTIAL COVERAGE determinations\n",
    "   - Uses Azure AI Search for policy document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Key Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `create_specialized_agents()`\n",
    "- Establishes Azure AI Agent client connections\n",
    "- Configures each agent with specialized instructions and capabilities\n",
    "- Sets up Cosmos DB plugins for data-enabled agents\n",
    "- Configures polling options for optimal performance\n",
    "- Returns a collection of ready-to-use specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### `run_insurance_claim_orchestration()`\n",
    "- **Concurrent Processing**: All three agents analyze claims simultaneously\n",
    "- **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Each agent receives specialized instructions\n",
    "- **Real-time Data Access**: Agents can retrieve claim data using provided claim IDs\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates unified analysis reports combining all agent outputs\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management and resource cleanup\n",
    "- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging of orchestration stages\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Orchestration Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Creation**: Initializes three specialized insurance processing agents\n",
    "2. **Concurrent Orchestration Setup**: Creates parallel execution framework\n",
    "3. **Task Distribution**: Assigns specialized analysis tasks to each agent\n",
    "4. **Parallel Execution**: All agents work simultaneously on their respective analyses\n",
    "5. **Result Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates outputs from all agents\n",
    "6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis report with all findings\n",
    "7. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly terminates runtime and releases resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates a comprehensive **Insurance Claim Analysis Report** that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Agent Assessments**: Detailed analysis from each specialized perspective\n",
    "- **Claim Validity Status**: Complete documentation and accuracy assessment\n",
    "- **Risk Profile Analysis**: Fraud indicators and authenticity evaluation\n",
    "- **Policy Coverage Determination**: Coverage eligibility and terms validation\n",
    "- **Unified Recommendations**: Consolidated next steps based on all agent analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent Execution**: True parallelism for faster processing\n",
    "- **Database Integration**: Real-time access to claim and policy data\n",
    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "- The claim CL001 is connected to a reported incident involving a legally parked 2004 Honda Accord which was struck by a gray pickup truck while parked. The incident occurred on July 17, 2025, at around 8:30 AM in a parking lot located on 2325 Main Street, Springfield, OH.\n",
      "- The damage description aligns with the given incident: front bumper dislodged, significant dents, paint transfer, and potential hidden mechanical damage. This is consistent with a side/front parking lot collision.\n",
      "- The presence of a witness with contact information and a police report number (25-52814 from Springfield Police Dept.) adds credibility to the claim.\n",
      "- The repair shop and damage estimate documentation are available which supports the claim for the repair request.\n",
      "- The timing of the claim, around three days after the incident, is reasonable and not suspicious.\n",
      "- The claimants' signature and date (July 20, 2025), witness statement, and photo evidence are consistent with a bona fide claim.\n",
      "- The claimant has one additional recent claim reported just two days later on July 19, 2025, involving a different vehicle and incident. While multiple claims in a short timeframe can sometimes raise flags, these two claims involve distinct vehicles, different locations, and separate police reports which reduces suspicion.\n",
      "- The environmental and damage descriptions in the photos are consistent with the damage reported in the claim.\n",
      "- No unusual timing or unsubstantiated repair costs are apparent at this stage.\n",
      "- No geographic or temporal clustering of suspicious claims is evident from the available data.\n",

      "- There are witness details and a police report referenced with a valid report number from Springfield Police Dept.\n",
      "- Attachments include photos of vehicle damage, the police report, and an estimate from the repair shop.\n",
      "- The claimant's signature and date are present, confirming the submission and legitimacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incident and Damage Description:\n",
      "- Incident involved the claimant‚Äôs vehicle legally parked when struck by another vehicle, causing damage primarily to the front bumper, driver's side quarter panel, wheel, tire, door, headlamp, grille, and potential hidden mechanical damage.\n",
      "- The description matches the photographic evidence showing substantial damage to the front left area of the vehicle.\n",
      "- The nature of the accident (another vehicle striking while parking) is consistent and plausible with supporting police and witness information.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Damage Assessment:\n",
      "- Damage is moderate to severe, involving structural and mechanical components.\n",
