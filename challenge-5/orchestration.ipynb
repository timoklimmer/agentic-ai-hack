    "# üìã Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `orchestration.ipynb` notebook implements a **sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system** for insurance claim processing using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** and **Azure AI Agent Service**. This notebook demonstrates advanced concurrent agent coordination to analyze insurance claims from multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",
    "- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: Agent orchestration framework\n",
    "- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Cloud-based agent hosting and management\n",
    "- **Concurrent Orchestration**: Parallel execution of multiple AI agents\n",
    "- **Azure Cosmos DB Integration**: Real-time data access through custom plugins\n",
    "- **Azure Identity**: Secure authentication for Azure services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Specializations\n",
    "The system creates three specialized AI agents that work concurrently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Claim Reviewer Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates claim documentation completeness\n",
    "   - Analyzes damage assessments and cost estimates\n",
    "   - Identifies inconsistencies or missing information\n",
    "   - Provides VALID/QUESTIONABLE/INVALID determinations\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for data retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Analyzer Agent**\n",
    "   - Detects fraud patterns and suspicious indicators\n",
    "   - Assesses claim authenticity and credibility\n",
    "   - Analyzes timing, amounts, and circumstances\n",
    "   - Provides LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk assessments\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for historical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìã Policy Checker Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates coverage against policy terms\n",
    "   - Interprets limits, deductibles, and exclusions\n",
    "   - Handles multiple policy types (Auto, Commercial, Motorcycle, etc.)\n",
    "   - Provides COVERED/NOT COVERED/PARTIAL COVERAGE determinations\n",
    "   - Uses Azure AI Search for policy document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Key Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `create_specialized_agents()`\n",
    "- Establishes Azure AI Agent client connections\n",
    "- Configures each agent with specialized instructions and capabilities\n",
    "- Sets up Cosmos DB plugins for data-enabled agents\n",
    "- Configures polling options for optimal performance\n",
    "- Returns a collection of ready-to-use specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### `run_insurance_claim_orchestration()`\n",
    "- **Concurrent Processing**: All three agents analyze claims simultaneously\n",
    "- **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Each agent receives specialized instructions\n",
    "- **Real-time Data Access**: Agents can retrieve claim data using provided claim IDs\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates unified analysis reports combining all agent outputs\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management and resource cleanup\n",
    "- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging of orchestration stages\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Orchestration Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Creation**: Initializes three specialized insurance processing agents\n",
    "2. **Concurrent Orchestration Setup**: Creates parallel execution framework\n",
    "3. **Task Distribution**: Assigns specialized analysis tasks to each agent\n",
    "4. **Parallel Execution**: All agents work simultaneously on their respective analyses\n",
    "5. **Result Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates outputs from all agents\n",
    "6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis report with all findings\n",
    "7. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly terminates runtime and releases resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates a comprehensive **Insurance Claim Analysis Report** that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Agent Assessments**: Detailed analysis from each specialized perspective\n",
    "- **Claim Validity Status**: Complete documentation and accuracy assessment\n",
    "- **Risk Profile Analysis**: Fraud indicators and authenticity evaluation\n",
    "- **Policy Coverage Determination**: Coverage eligibility and terms validation\n",
    "- **Unified Recommendations**: Consolidated next steps based on all agent analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent Execution**: True parallelism for faster processing\n",
    "- **Database Integration**: Real-time access to claim and policy data\n",
    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "\n",
      "Analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Claim Documentation and Completeness:\n",
      "- The claim includes comprehensive details: claimant info, vehicle details (2004 Honda Accord), incident specifics (date, time, location), damage description, witness info, police department and report number, repair shop details, and attachments including photos, police report, and repair estimate.\n",
      "- The claimant provided a signed claim request dated July 20, 2025.\n",
      "- There is clear documentation of a witness and police involvement with official report numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incident and Damage Assessment:\n",
      "- Incident occurred in a parking lot, described as a collision by another vehicle attempting to park.\n",
      "- Damage described matches the images showing front left side impact: bumper partially detached, dented quarter panel, paint transfer on driver‚Äôs door, damaged tire and headlamp, plus possible hidden mechanical damage.\n",
      "- The damage severity is moderate to severe, involves both cosmetic and potential structural components (wheel, suspension).\n",
      "- The description and photos provide consistent evidence supporting the claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Damage Estimates:\n",
      "- Repair shop provided an estimate, which is included as an attachment.\n",
      "- The damage scope justifies the estimate covering bodywork, mechanical inspection, and parts replacement.\n",
      "- Using a spare tire indicates the vehicle is not drivable in current condition and needs professional repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Evidence and Verification:\n",
      "- Photos attached confirm visual damage consistent with claimant's description.\n",
      "- Police report available, indicating official investigation.\n",
      "- Witness named with contact info, adding credibility.\n",
      "- Repair shop identified for assessment and repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Additional Considerations:\n",
      "- The claim references an additional, separate crash involving a different vehicle owned by the claimant, but that does not conflict with the present claim.\n",
      "- Incident timing, description, and follow-up actions align logically without suspicious patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missing Documentation or Concerns:\n",
      "- There is no mention of claimant‚Äôs deductible or policy coverage validation here (to be confirmed by policy checker).\n",
      "- Confirmation of all repair estimate details and possible mechanical evaluation results could strengthen the claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "- Proceed with mechanical inspection of hidden damage, especially behind bumper and suspension.\n",
      "- Verify coverage and deductible applicability with policy terms.\n",
      "- Schedule vehicle inspection and repairs per repair shop‚Äôs estimate.\n",
      "- Confirm claim payment after validation of repair completion and cost reasonableness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "The claim is well-documented, consistent, supported by evidence, and repair needs are reasonable given damage. There are no red flags indicating fraud or incompleteness. It should be considered valid pending confirmation of repair costs against policy coverage and deductible.\n",

      "- Repair estimates provided from a credible local body shop.\n",
