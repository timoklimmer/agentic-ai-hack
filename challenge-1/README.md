# Challenge 1: Document Processing and Vectorized Search

**Expected Duration:** 60 minutes

## Introduction
Welcome to Challenge 1! In this challenge, you'll build a comprehensive document processing and search system using Azure AI services. This foundational challenge demonstrates how to process insurance documents (both text and images), create vectorized search capabilities, and prepare the knowledge base that will power all subsequent AI agent implementations.

## What are we building?
In this challenge, we will create a complete document processing and vectorized search system that forms the backbone of our insurance AI agent ecosystem:

- **Document Upload System**: Azure Blob Storage integration for secure document management
- **Multimodal Processing Pipeline**: GPT-4-1-mini powered text and image processing capabilities  
- **OCR Extraction System**: Advanced text extraction from insurance claim images
- **Vectorized Search Index**: Azure AI Search with integrated vectorization for semantic search
- **Hybrid Search Capabilities**: Combined keyword, vector, and semantic search functionality

This system will serve as the knowledge foundation for all agents in subsequent challenges, enabling them to access and query insurance policies, claims, and statements intelligently.

## Why Document Processing and Vectorized Search?
Document processing and vectorized search serve as the foundation for intelligent AI agent systems because they enable agents to understand, query, and reason over complex multimodal content. By converting unstructured documents and images into searchable, semantically-rich representations, we create a knowledge base that agents can query naturally using human language. The combination of Azure AI Search's integrated vectorization with GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities ensures that agents can access both textual policies and visual claim documentation with equal sophistication, enabling comprehensive insurance processing workflows.

## Exercise Guide - Build Your Knowledge Foundation!

### Part 1 - Document Processing Pipeline

Time to process all your documents! Please jump over to `1.document-processing.ipynb` file for a comprehensive walkthrough on:
- Setting up Azure Blob Storage for document management
- Processing text documents using GPT-4o
- Extracting text from images using GPT-4o vision capabilities
- Preparing documents for vectorization

Please make sure to carefully review all cells, as they demonstrate critical multimodal AI processing techniques.

### Part 2 - Vectorized Search Implementation

Time to create your search index! Please jump over to `2.document-vectorizing.ipynb` file for a detailed implementation of:
- Azure AI Search index configuration with integrated vectorization
- Document upload and automatic vectorization pipeline
- Hybrid search capabilities (keyword + vector + semantic)
- Search testing and validation across document types

Great! If you are finished and ready for extra challenges, there's much more to explore!

### Part 3 - Advanced Search Capabilities (Optional)
Part of building robust AI systems is expanding beyond basic functionality. Your optional challenge is to enhance your search capabilities with:

**Advanced Query Processing**: Implement query expansion and refinement techniques
**Custom Scoring Profiles**: Create specialized ranking algorithms for insurance content
**Real-time Processing**: Set up automatic document processing workflows
**Multi-language Support**: Extend processing to handle documents in multiple languages

You can find implementation guidance in the [Azure AI Search documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/).

## Data Structure Overview

Your challenge includes comprehensive insurance data across three categories:

| Data Category | Files | Purpose |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| **Claims Data** (`data/claims/`) | `crash1.jpg`, `crash2.jpg`, `crash3.jpg`, `crash4.jpeg`, `crash5.jpg`, `invoice.png` | Vehicle accident documentation and repair invoices for OCR processing |
| **Policy Data** (`data/policies/`) | `commercial_auto_policy.md`, `comprehensive_auto_policy.md`, `high_value_vehicle_policy.md`, `liability_only_policy.md`, `motorcycle_policy.md` | Insurance policy documents for text processing and policy validation |
| **Claim Statements** (`data/statements/`) | `crash1.md` through `crash5.md` | Written statements corresponding to each claim for comprehensive analysis |

### Understanding the Implementation: Azure AI Search with Integrated Vectorization

When building intelligent search systems, Azure AI Search with integrated vectorization provides a streamlined approach where documents are automatically processed and vectorized using built-in AI skills and embedding models like text-embedding-ada-002. This eliminates the need for custom vectorization pipelines while providing enterprise-grade search capabilities including semantic ranking, vector search, and hybrid search combinations. The integrated approach is ideal for scenarios where you need rapid implementation of sophisticated search capabilities across multimodal content, as demonstrated in our insurance document processing system that handles both textual policies and visual claim documentation through a unified search interface.
